# Flexible wrapper for Atom

The Wrapper let's you wrap text in any html tag including an optional attribute. You can set a default html tag to use as well as an optional attribute to add in the settings.

This package builds on the excellent base code from (atom-wrap-in-tag)[https://github.com/sanusart/atom-wrap-in-tag]

# How to use it

Just select a text and press 'ctr + alt + w'

To set a custom tag to use or an optional attribute to include in a tag, go to:

File -> Settings -> Packages - > Wrapper -> Settings
